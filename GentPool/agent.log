INFO:root:The George Mason University Natural Language Processing (NLP) group is part of the university's broader research initiatives in artificial intelligence and computational linguistics. The group focuses on various aspects of NLP, including but not limited to machine learning, text analysis, information retrieval, and language understanding. 

Researchers in the group often work on projects that involve developing algorithms and models to process and analyze human language, contributing to advancements in areas such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, and dialogue systems. The group may also collaborate with other departments and institutions, engaging in interdisciplinary research that combines insights from linguistics, computer science, and cognitive science.

For the most current information about their research projects, publications, and activities, it's best to visit their official website or check recent publications from the group.
